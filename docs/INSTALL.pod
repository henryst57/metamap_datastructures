=head1 MetaMap-DataStructures

This package provides a container for the information extracted 
from machine readable MetaMap mapped text. 

=head1 TESTING PLATFORMS

MetaMap-DataStructures has been developed and tested on Linux 
primarily using Perl and the Bash shell. 

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

MetaMap-DataStructures REQUIRES that the following software be installed. 
More details on how to obtain and install appear below. 

--Programming Languages
Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

--CPAN modules
<MODULE NAME>

=head1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

=head2 Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

Perl is freely available at:

L<http://www.perl.org>

It is very likely that you will already have Perl installed 
if you are using a Unix/Linux based system. 

=head1 INSTALLATION 

If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local 
install, you can install via: 

 perl -MCPAN -e shell
 > install MetaMap-DataStructures 


If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,  
unpacking, and executing the following commands. 

                perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                make
                make test
                make install

Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you create 
a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access. 

You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment 
variable to access this module when running.

If you have the super-user access, then you can install MetaMap-DataStructures 
into system directories via :
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install
	 	make clean

The exact location of where MetaMap-DataStructures will be installed 
depends on your system configuration. A message will be printed 
out after 'make install' telling your exactly where it was installed.
